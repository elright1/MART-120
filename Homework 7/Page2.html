    <h1>Short Story</h1>
    <br>
    <h2 style="color: burlywood; background-color:blanchedalmond ;" >A father went to say good night to his seven year old son, very well knowing that if he didn’t his son would have trouble sleeping. It was a nightly routine between them. He entered the dimly lit room where his son waited under his blanket. With the first glance the father could tell there was something unusual about his son tonight, but couldn’t put his finger on it. He looked the same but had a grin that drew from ear to ear.

        “You okay, buddy?” the father asked.
        
        The son nodded, still with the grin, before saying, “Daddy, check for monsters under my bed.”
        
        The father chuckled a bit before getting on his knees to check only to satisfy his son.
        
        There, under the bed, pale and afraid, was his son. His real son. He whispered, “Daddy, there someone on my bed”.</p>
